# DevOps-course

### Hi there, I'm Ruslan. I'm not a blogger and I don't really like to write about myself.
  
I went the hard way from a sperm to a <del>submarine commander</del> system administrator.  
And now I decided to move towards DevOps.  

I hope you know the feeling when you see a new mechanism - it's interesting.  
But this is not just interesting. You're wondering how it works.  
And to understand how it works, you first need to break it.  
But breaking is not in order to break, but in order to understand how to take care of it so that it works better.  
Then put it back together.  
Then try to improve, add a gear...  
In the end, break everything completely, throw it in the trash and make your own mechanism that works better.  
Then again, disassemble and improve everything...  
And this process is endless.  
I hope you understand why DevOps.
