# DevOps-course

### Hi there, I'm Ruslan. I'm not a blogger and I don't really like to write about myself.
  
I went the hard way from a sperm to a <del>submarine commander</del> system administrator.  
And now I decided to move towards DevOps.  

I hope you know the feeling when you see a new mechanism - it's interesting.  
But this is not just interesting. You're wondering how it works.  
And to understand how it works, you first need to break it.  
But breaking is not in order to break, but in order to understand how to take care of it so that it works better.  
Then put it back together.  
Then try to improve, add a gear...  
In the end, break everything completely, throw it in the trash and make your own mechanism that works better.  
Then again, disassemble and improve everything...  
And this process is endless.  
I hope you understand why DevOps.  
  
In our time, learning is most often self-education. There are pros and cons to this.  
The plus is that this approach makes you think for yourself. Your own style is being developed.  
The biggest disadvantage is that it's easy to get lost without experienced menthors.
You can go in the wrong direction and a lot of time wil be lost.  
That's what makes a good school different which teaches to think independently and at the same time helps 
to study the rich expirience of predecessors, saving time.  
  
### I hope that this course will help me:  
1. Explore different approaches to solving problems and learn how to choose them optimally in each case.
2. Learn the best practice of real masters in using tools.
3. And inthe end, put the whole development cycle in my head, realise my place in it and develop further.
